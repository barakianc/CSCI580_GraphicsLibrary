I used a flat Red for my background color.  My procedural texture is a checkerboard pattern with one color being
based off a noise function and there other is a gradiant.  I moddifed the Application5 to now create and array of
renderd and displays, one for each of the aa offsets.  This also required modifying Application.h, Application.cpp, 
and CS580HW.cpp to now handle m_pRender as an array instead of a render class.
